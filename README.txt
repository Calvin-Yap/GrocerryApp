GroceryCart and NutritionChart are done
All the buttons are functional with drawing the boxes and adding to cart and everything
Dragging implementation is 90% done but sometimes adding the boxes by intersection may lead it to adding in the wrong order
Everything done in the video works except for dragging the grapes
