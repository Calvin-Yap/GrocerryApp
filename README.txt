Final Project for CPS209 
it is a groccery cart simulation, still has its bugs but it is running as it should be.




GroceryCart and NutritionChart are done
All the buttons are functional with drawing the boxes and adding to cart and everything
Dragging implementation is 90% done but sometimes adding the boxes by intersection may lead it to adding in the wrong order
Everything done in the video works except for dragging the grapes
